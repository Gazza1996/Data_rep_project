# data_rep_project
Third Year Software Development Data Representation &amp; Querying Project

My app will be a bucket list app where a user can sign up, sign in, create a new item to their bucket list and then logout again and save as many items to the list as they want.

I first started my project by researching different web app ideas on github and the google search engine. I had many different ideas such as a currency converter, a percentage calculator and then my final idea a bucket list.


To start my project i first had to install the different flask packages needed to run the python files.
// edit here
After this i began creating my index.html file by using a bootstrap method called Jumbotron which i found on the bootstrap website to design my application. I then defined a method in my data.py file in order to run the file in my browser.

I then further designed my html by adding a new signin.html file where i can sign in as a user. I once again used the bootstrap jumbotron method. I then had to create a new function in data.py to call the html file.

I created my database then in table.py which created bucketlist.db in my data_rep folder. I went on to create dummy.py which is a python file that runs in the background to allow input of user in the sign in method.

Following this i created a bucketList.html file which allows a user to input text and create a new entry to their bucket list.

For my project i used different tutorial videos on youtube that taught me how to operate Python, Flask and HTML
I also used the following links as guidelines:
