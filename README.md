# data_rep_project
Third Year Software Development Data Representation &amp; Querying Project

My app will be a bucket list app where a user can sign up, sign in,
create a new item to their bucket list and then logout again and save
as many items to the list as they want. 

For my project i used different tutorial videos on youtube that taught
me how to operate Python, Flask and HTML

I also used the following links as guidelines
